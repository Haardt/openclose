# Open Close Principle
aka 
## The yummiest Coding Dojo ever! :icecream: :yum:

Imagine summer...:sunny: :sunglasses:

You feel hot, a cup of icecream would be awesome!
No problem! 
You're a software developer and you and your colleague have created a service that serves a nice cup of icecream.
But your colleague just added [detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) and now your project doesn't build anymore!

In order to get a nice cup of icecream you need to refactor your codebase so that the detekt issue goes away.
`@Suppress` is not allowed, otherwise your boss will get mad! :rage:
  
Maybe some kind of abstraction would be a good idea...
